## Stop Go Continue

##### Stop:

1. 'stop planning my wedding during projects'
2. 'stop giving up so quickly BUT ask for help sooner'

##### Go:

1. 'assign yourself to issues & check that someone else is not already assigned on to a task'
2. 'think about branch naming conventions' - We concluded to have one branch per issue and delete it once merged. Make the branch names descriptive.
3. 'use issues more, create one before every task bigger than 5 minutes'

##### Continue:

1. 'everyone going through code together to see changes' (so you get familiar with code you didn't write)
2. 'give chance to learn new things by giving the task to the people who will find it most difficult/rewarding'
3. 'asking colleagues for expertise - communication'
4. 'making Cleo happy' (she feels that we had a great project and she learn a lot, good teamwork)
5. 'continue to not make changes overnight'
6. 'explaining well to each other'
7. 'realistic decisions given time' (good time management at the beginning of the project)
8. 'proper pair programming and not veering off for ages'
9. 'explain the process you went through on the issues if it was troublesome, so we can learn/reference in the future'
10. 'stopping every so often to explain our code to each other'
