[UX Prototype](https://github.com/a-la-node/hapi-project/blob/readme-update/proto.gif "UX Prototype")

## What?
- Create a templated web app using hapi
- Utilise 2 APIs - random name generator and nomad - finding working and living space
- Strong test coverage

## User Story

### General User Story
As... someone who wants to start a new life
I want to... be able to create a new identity
and get suggestions on where to start my new life.

### Broken-down User Stories

As an...  ex-convict
I want to... be able to create a new name
so that... I can recreate myself.

As a... witness (in a court trial)
I want to... find somewhere to stay
so that... I have a roof over my head whilst escape the criminals trying to hunt me down.

As a... bad spouse who has been thrown out
I want to... find somewhere to work
so that... I can earn some cash whilst I move around and re-piece my relationship.

As a... spy
I want to... be able to create a new identity (job/ phone no etc)
so that... I can trick the people I encounter and obtain crucial insider information.


## How?
- TDD using server.inject for testing
- Host the project on heroku
- Try to use basic ES6 syntax
- Pair programming


## Stretch Goals
- Tailor users' results to their custom preferences
- Display users' results in a more visually organised/ appealing way (hide irrelevant options)
